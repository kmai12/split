<%-- Change this to match your new starting-point JSF page. 
     If you know how to use welcome-page in web.xml, omit index.jsp
     and just make index.jsf (or whatever) be the welcome page.
     You can also just use a simple index.html welcome page and then
     have LINKS to the various starting .jsf pages. That is what the
     "basics" project does, so see that for an example.
